            <h1 class="intro">Spanish Entrees</h1>
            <p class="introp">Spanish cuisine uses a lot of fresh fruits and
            vegetables as well as meat, in spite of the fact that during the
            30's, meat eating was often denounced as 'bourgeois'. Many of the
            entrees are big main courses, but others are in Tapas fashion,
            which essentially means that it is a smaller dish meant to be eaten
            with other small dishes. My programmer particularly likes pairing
            these recipes with either a tempranillo wine or sangria.</p>

                       href="paprikachicken.html">Paprika Baked Chicken</a></dt>
                <dd>This dish is a rather large entree that can be made rather
                easily. It is a meat and potatoes style of simplicity that, if
                properly baked, comes out juicy and delicious.</dd>

                    la Ranchera</a></dt>
                <dd>More of a tapas dish, huevos a la ranchera is baked in a
                small baking dish with a sofrito base, different kinds of meats
                and topped with an egg. Initially an Andalusiano breakfast
                dish, this is often made as a tapas meal.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="stuffedtomatoes.html">Stuffed
                    Tomatoes</a></dt>
                <dd>A different take on stuffed peppers. This tapas-style dish
                adds all the savory deliciousness of meat and cheese to a
                fresh tasting tomato.</dd>
