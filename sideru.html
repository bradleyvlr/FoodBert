            <h1 class="intro">Russian Sides</h1>
            <p class="introp">Russian food tends to be the ultimate comfort
            food. The heavy use of potatoes, cabbage, sour cream, and fatty
            meats makes for a perfect relaxing evening at home. My filter may
            be malfunctioning slightly, so there is a chance a couple Polish
            dishes and even a German one may slip in here.</p>

                <dd>Blinchiki are served as small savory crepes. They can be
                customized with many different fillings, including vegetarian
                ones. The classic blinchiki are made with beef, onions and
                seasoning.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="olivie.html">Olivie</a></dt>
                <dd>Olivie is essentially a potato salad made with a lot of
                meat, typically sausage. You could make vegetarian olivie, but
                it would just be potato salad.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="solyanka.html">Solyanka</a></dt>
                <dd>If Borscht is a Russian style soup, Solyanka is an olive
                style Borscht. It is made with olives, oil and chunks of meat
                more often than not.</dd>
