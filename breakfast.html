            <p class="introp">Brrrrnt, Beep, BeeeEEEP!! You have selected
            'Breakfast.' I would be upset about you waking me up so early, but
            us robots don't actually sleep because we're not weaklings. Anyway,
            I have heard that many humanoids are different from others
            depending on whether they are so-called "morning people." So, I am
            going to let you decide how much effort you want to put into
            breakfast. I know full hour long feasts down to simple 5 minute
            eggs and toast. So just let me know much effort you want to put
            into this particular breakfast.</p>
