                <dd>Cinnamon toast is about as easy as it gets. And of course
                it is incredibly delicious. All you need is bread, butter, a
                toaser, and cinnamon sugar.</dd>

                    Blanket</a></dt>
                <dd>This is a well known country breakfast in the USA. Canned
                croissants are wrapped around tiny hot dogs and cheese and
                baked.</dd>
