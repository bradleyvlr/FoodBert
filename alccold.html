            have a beer or wine, you can try serving one of these beverages.
            They go particularly well with a nice evening on the porch.</p>

                <dd>The Red Sangria is a traditional Spanish drink. It is made
                from Red wine and fresh fruit, often with other ingredients to
                increase sweetness or Alcohol content. This pairs well either
                with a good meal or with a good party.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="sangriablanca.html">Sangria Blanca</a></dt>
                <dd>The White Sangria is a little bit lighter than its red
                counterpart, and is often a bit sweeter. There are so many
                variations on making sangria, that this recipe will provide the
                basic essence of making it with a few options.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="margarita.html">Classic Margarita</a></dt>
                <dd>The margarita is a classic and can be served chilled or
                frozen (like a slushy). This recipe is for the base and will
                offer a few variations for customizeable margaritas.</dd>
