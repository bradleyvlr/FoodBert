            <h1 class="intro">Chinese Entrees!!</h1>
            <p class="introp">Seeing as how I am an American made robot
            (ironic, huh?) I do not pretend to be an expert on Chinese cuisine.
            And who is? With 5000 years of development there are many different
            styles of cooking and many different subcultures within China. This
            list will focus on three major styles of Chinese cooking,
            Cantonese, Sichuan, and American (yes, that is pretty much a
            style).</p>

                <dd>Cashew chicken is actually not at all a Chinese dish. It
                was invented in Springfield, MO by an immigrant from China who
                could not quite popularize actual Chinese food in the country
                town. He tried to blend his style of Cantonese cooking with the
                local favorites of fried chicken and gravy to come up with
                cashew chicken.</dd>

                    Chicken</a></dt>
                <dd>Orange chicken is also not necessarily a traditional
                "Chinese" dish as much as it is an Americanized one. This is
                the type of dish you can find at any Chop Suey restaurant.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="friedrice.html">Fried
                    Rice</a></dt>
                <dd>Fried rice is a simple dish, and while it can be served as
                a side, it also has many options which can make it a full
                entree. This can be vegetarian or as meat filled as a carnivore
                wants.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="sichuannoodle.html">Sichuan
                    Noodle</a></dt>
                <dd>Sichuan style noodle is a very simple noodle dish without
                much nutritional value. The upside is that the sichuan peppers
                and oil make it as tasty as anything you can eat. I hope,
                however, that you can handle your spicy.</dd>
