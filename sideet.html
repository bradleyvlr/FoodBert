            <h1 class="intro">Ethiopian Entree</h1>
            <p class="introp">The only cuisine from the African continent that
            many Americans have experience with is Ethiopian. Perhaps when my
            programmer becomes more cultured and gets around to FoodBert 3.0 he
            may include some more types of food. Anyway Ethiopian cuisine
            typically revolves around a more community oreinted dining
            experience. Often the entrees are served to the entire table atop a
            thin almost pita-type sourdough bread called injera. People use the
            injera with their fingers to pick up the very saucy foods often
            made with lentils, other vegetables or meats. It's often a sign of
            affection for tablemates to feed each other. And often sides are
            served on the same injera as the entree.</p>

                <dd>Azifa is a side dish made with black lentils and spicy
                ground mustard. It has a burn similar to horseradish and tastes
                wonderfully with injera.</dd>

                <dd>Often made as a side for Ethiopian dishes, yellow lentils
                are boiled often to a creamy and buttery state left almost as a
                sauce texture.</dd>
