            <h1 class="intro">Chinese Sides!!</h1>
            <p class="introp">Seeing as how I am an American made robot
            (ironic, huh?) I do not pretend to be an expert on Chinese cuisine.
            And who is? With 5000 years of development there are many different
            styles of cooking and many different subcultures within China. This
            list will focus on three major styles of Chinese cooking,
            Cantonese, Sichuan, and American (yes, that is pretty much a
            style). These should pair with any Chinese entree.</p>

                       href="eggrolls.html">Egg Rolls</a></dt>
                <dd>I was not programmed with the ability to know whether or
                not egg rolls are actually served within China. They are
                certainly served at American Chinese restaurants, though. These
                are meat and veggies wrapped in wontons and deep fried.</dd>

                <dd>More deep fried wonton. This is stuffed with cream cheese,
                and sometimes even crab or green onion.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="friedrice.html">Fried
                    Rice</a></dt>
                <dd>Fried rice is a simple dish, and while it can be served as
                a side, it also has many options which can make it a full
                entree. This can be vegetarian or as meat filled as a carnivore
                wants.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="shrimpdumpling.html">Shrimp
                    Dumplings</a></dt>
                <dd>Sometimes served as a Dim Sum entree, Shrimp Dumplings can
                be a great side. Shrimp and chives wrapped in a wonton, steamed
                and topped with caviar makes for a wonderfully showy appetizer.</dd>
