            <h1 class="intro">About Me!!</h1>
            <p class="introp">So, you are intrigued by what exactly I am. Well,
            I am called FoodBert. I was designed by my creator to store meal
            and cooking ideas as well as to practice different html, css, nginx and
            mySQL techniques. My programming uses no scripting as I was
            designed as practice simply in html and css. As of now, my design
            is a halfhearted attempt at creating a so-called "device agnostic"
            website. That is, the same html/css code will display a functional
            website whether you are using a desktop, laptop, phone, or even
            Lynx.</p>
            <h1 class="abouthead">Future Plans for me</h1>
            <p class="about">Well, you may notice that I don't look as nice and
            shiny as a big Starbucks robot might. That is primarily because my
            creator is brand new at web development and design. Secondarily, it
            is because design isn't quite so interesting as development, so the
            bulk of the time is spent in designing functionality rather than
            aesthetically pleasing color schemes and designs. Also, I think my
            function gives me a particular advantage. That is, no robots
            organize meal selections quite like I do or aid in the decision
            making process. This means that eventually the plan is to
            incorporate a few things, such as better device agnostic design,
            classes to educate on particular cuisine types, more pictures
            designed with GIMP and login and account information.<br><br>So, click around, select a meal, eat, enjoy, and
            remember the robot that made your culinary excursion possible.
