            morning, and you want to put together something a little special,
            these 30 minute breakfasts are a pretty good idea.</p>

                <dd>This country meal is what my programmer ate at his
                grandparents' house every day. Homemade biscuits, eggs, and
                bacon with gravy.</dd>

                Hash Browns</a></dt>
                <dd>This recipe can take a while, especially if you elect to
                use whole potatoes, as opposed to frozen parboiled ones (whole
                ones taste better and cost about 1/4 the price).</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="crepes.html">Crepes</a></dt>
                <dd>Crepes are like thin pancakes and can be customized in
                almost any way. They can be sweet or savory, fruity or
                chocolatey, steak or chicken, or whatever you like. It is
                recommended to have a crepe iron, but not a necessity.</dd>
