            <p class="introp">Most breakfasts are meant to be prepared rather
            quickly in order to get a start on the day, so most familiar
            breakfasts fall into the 10 to 30 minute category.</p>

                <dd>French toast is a classic breakfast item, and it's so
                simple that most kid's cookbooks have recipes for it.</dd>

                    Biscuits</a></dt>
                <dd>Biscuits are rarely served by themselves, but making these
                biscuits with some of the gravy recipes can be delicious and
                hearty in themselves. Also, most gravies require grease which
                comes from cooking breakfast meat.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="omelettes.html">Omelettes</a></dt>
                <dd>Omelettes are a classic breakfast made mostly with eggs.
                They can be as simple as eggs with a little cheese, to whole
                vegetable and meat medleys cooked into them.</dd>
