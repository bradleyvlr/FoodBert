            <h1 class="intro">Korean Sides!!</h1>
            <p class="introp">A little taste of Korean food is good for the
            soul. Korea has a long history and culture with a very interesting
            development. Years of general isolation as the so-called "Hermit
            Kingdom" made for a culture developing differently from nearby
            regions such as China, or Vietnam. However, imperialism of Japan
            and the United States, as well as other nations, did blend many
            types of cooking with older Korean forms. So some recipes may seem
            similar to other styles, but they all do have a uniquely Korean
            character about them.</p>

                <dd>Kimchi is one of the most ubiquitous of Korean foods.
                Essentially it is a spicy fermented cabbage. This can take a
                couple of days to make, but generally it is fairly easy.</dd>
                <dt><a href="pajeon.html">Pajeon</a></dt>
                <dd>Pajeon is in between a savory pancake and an omelette. Made
                with egg, vegetables and usually shrimp, it complements most
                meals.</dd>
                <dt><a href="gyerenmari.html">Gyerenmari</a></dt>
                <dd>This is essentially a Korean egg roll. However it is not a
                fried wonton, it is literally a rolled, cooked egg. It is like
                a thin veggie omelette, rolled and cut into bite size pieces.</dd>
