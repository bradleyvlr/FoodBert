            <p class="introp">So, the actual construction of cooking classes
            may be a long way off, but my creator thought it a good idea to
            incorporate it into the design of the site from the get go. I don't
            actually know why, because the design isn't that great anyway if
            you ask me, but don't tell him I said that. Anyway, the general
            idea is that since I know so many different types of cuisine, each
            class would be a course in each type of cuisine. For instance a
            class in Korean cuisine would involve some Korean history, classic
            holiday foods, basic spices used in most dishes and practice in
            many of the recipes. Ideally, this would also involve videos on how
            to cook, but that is likely a long way off, too. </p>
