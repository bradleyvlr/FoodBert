            <h1 class="intro">Ethiopian Entree</h1>
            <p class="introp">The only cuisine from the African continent that
            many Americans have experience with is Ethiopian. Perhaps when my
            programmer becomes more cultured and gets around to FoodBert 3.0 he
            may include some more types of food. Anyway Ethiopian cuisine
            typically revolves around a more community oreinted dining
            experience. Often the entrees are served to the entire table atop a
            thin almost pita-type sourdough bread called injera. People use the
            injera with their fingers to pick up the very saucy foods often
            made with lentils, other vegetables or meats. It's often a sign of
            affection for tablemates to feed each other.</p>

                       href="stringbeanandcarrot.html">String Bean and Carrot</a></dt>
                <dd>As far as I was programmed to know, there really is no
                fancier name for string bean and carrot. And it is just that,
                string beans and carrots made with seasonings and a tomato
                sauce, served with injera.</dd>

                <dt><a class="recname" href="meattibs.html">[Meat] Tibs</a></dt>
                <dd>Made with your choice of meat, often chicken, beef, lamb or
                shrimp, tibs is a common Ethiopian dish made with onions,
                peppers and seasonings as well as olive oil to give it a rich
                hearty flavor.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="dorowat.html">Doro Wat</a></dt>
                <dd>Doro Wat is essentially a cabbage and potato dish made with
                a type of seasoned sauce similar to a curry. While it is very
                simple, it makes a very tasty and hearty soul of an injera
                plate.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="redlentilstew.html">Red Lentil
                    Stew</a></dt>
                <dd>Lentils are a common ingredient in Ethiopian cooking since
                they are highly nutritious and can be made quite delicious in
                numerous unique ways. This particular stew is very thick and
                made with garlic and onions to flavor up an injera plate.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="injera.htl">Injera</a></dt>
                <dd>While Injera is not, in itself, an entree, it is a
                necessary component to every entree listed here. It is a very
                thin sourdough bread that is used to eat with your fingers. It
                can be purchased at many African food stores, or you can make
                it yourself for extra cool points.</dd>
