            <h1 class="intro">Korean Entrees!!</h1>
            <p class="introp">A little taste of Korean food is good for the
            soul. Korea has a long history and culture with a very interesting
            development. Years of general isolation as the so-called "Hermit
            Kingdom" made for a culture developing differently from nearby
            regions such as China, or Vietnam. However, imperialism of Japan
            and the United States, as well as other nations, did blend many
            types of cooking with older Korean forms. So some recipes may seem
            similar to other styles, but they all do have a uniquely Korean
            character about them.</p>

                <dd>Essentially a teryaki stir fry noodle dish, Japchae is a
                rather hearty vegetarian dish. This can be served as an entree
                in itself, or it compliments another entree quite well.</dd>
                <dt><a href="bulgogi.html">Bulgogi BBQ</a></dt>
                <dd>Bulgogi is a type of marinade for meat in many Korean
                dishes. This is often a component of dishes like Bibimbap, or
                it can be served as its own big entree.</dd>
