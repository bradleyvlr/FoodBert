            <h1 class="intro">Hot Beverages</h1>
            <p class="introp">Particularly in the autumn and winter, it is
            amazing to have a nice hot beverage to relax to. I like a nice cup
            of 5W20 myself, but I'm told that poisonous to people. So anyway
            here is a nice list of hot drink that you can make.</p>

                <dd>Of course you need an espresso machine to make these
                recipes, but once you have that, these recipes are all fairly
                easy to make. You can even go a little crazy and add flavored
                syrups to your reportoire.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="chailatte.html">Chai Latte</a></dt>
                <dd>Unlike the espresso latte, all you need for this recipe is
                some form of chai, loose leaf, or teabag. This drink is rather
                versatile as it goes well by itself or with an Indian meal.</dd>

                <dd>I may be a robot, but even I dream of an elecric Hogwarts.
                This recipe is entirely unofficial, but it does taste
                delicious. You can also check out the cold, and alcoholic
                versions of this recipe.</dd>
