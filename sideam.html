            <h1 class="intro">American Sides</h1>
            <p class="introp">Hmm, I see you are in the mood for some classic
            American cuisine. Now, it is important to note that there is no
            monolithic entity of "American Food." America is a veritable gumbo
            of different cultures and cuisines. These recipes will hopefully
            complement the recipes in the entree section very well.</p>

                <dt><a class="recname"
                       href="fries.html">Good French Fries</a></dt>
                <dd>Humans are too illogical. Why is the most American of side
                dishes called "French." Anyway, fries are very simple, this
                will describe how to make them and offer some variations.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="bakedpotato.html">Baked Potatoes</a></dt>
                <dd>Another potato dish. This is extremely customizeable in
                that it can be made in almost infinitely many ways.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="friedokra.html">Fried
                    Okra</a></dt>
                <dd>This goes with any southern or cajun style dish. It's
                simple to make, but be careful. Experience shows that among a
                group of people there is no such thing as 'enough' fried okra.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="corn.html">Boiled Corn</a></dt>
                <dd>A lot of explicitly American cooking was developed in the
                country side. So simple grain dishes like corn-on-the-cob is a
                staple.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="mashedpotatoes.html">Mashed
                    Potatoes</a></dt>
                <dd>While not just American, mashed potatoes go with almost any
                traditional american meal. This recipe is delicious and
                includes a couple kinds of gravy.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname"
                       href="cornbread.html">Cornbread</a></dt>
                <dd>It's almost not worth adding this recipe, because most who
                cook already have a favorite corn bread recipe. But, for those
                who don't, here is one for you.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname"
                       href="greenbeancasserole.html">Green Bean Casserole</a></dt>
                <dd>If you have ever been to a potluck, you have probably seen
                at least a dozen green bean casseroles. I'm not sure what it is
                about the early 1900's that spawned some casserole loving
                people, but they came up with some great recipes.</dd>
