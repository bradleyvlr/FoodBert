            <h1 class="intro">Indian Entrees</h1>
            <p class="introp">Of course Indian cuisine is vast and
            heterogenious, but for the purposes of my programming, it is going
            to be loosely categorized into 'north' and 'south' style Indian
            food. Northern style foods are more likely to feature meat
            (although most Indian food features vegetarian dishes) and are
            dryer. Southern dishes tend to creamier and are more likely to be
            vegetarian. Incidentally, most people have heard of "Indian Curry"
            but "curry" as such does not denote any particular one recipe. 
            essentially just means "sauce with heavy seasonings."</p>

                <dd>Biryani is a northern dish that is essentially like a curry
                style fried rice. It is extremely customizeable with your
                choice of ingredients and can be made to be vegetarian if you
                wish.</dd>

                spinach. It is made with fresh spinach and a seasoned cream
                sauce and can be made with mix ins including mushroom, or
                chickpeas.</dd>
