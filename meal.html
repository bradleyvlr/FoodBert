            <h1 class="intro">FULL MEAL SELECTIONS!!</h1>
            <p class="introp">Beep, boop, boop, BEEEEEEEP! You selected 'FULL
            MEAL'. I did not know you were feeling so ambitious. So of course
            the 'FULL MEAL' selection will involve an entree, a side or two (or
            three) and perhaps a recommended beverage and dessert. Now, seeing
            as how your brain is made of some gooey grey substance, I cannot
            just list all of the meals for you because it would melt your
            non-robot mind. So I will give you some more options to choose
            from. We are going to decide based on which type of cuisine you are
            looking for. Now I'm doing this for your benefit so you can impress
            people with just how cultured you can pretend to be. So go on, pick
            away!</p>
