            <p class="introp">BOOOP, Beeeeeep!! You have selected 'DESSERT.' I
            hope that you are bringing this to a potluck or something. Because,
            if not, that means one of two things. Either you are eating a meal
            that you selected yourself, and are just asking me about dessert
            (which is bad because we both know I'm better at selecting
            recipes), or you are just planning to eat dessert (which is bad
            because non-robots like yourself can get fat that way). Oh well,
            its your life and your decision to eat bad food or get fat, so how
            much time are you trying to spend on a dessert?</p>
