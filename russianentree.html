            <h1 class="intro">Russian Entrees</h1>
            <p class="introp">Russian food tends to be the ultimate comfort
            food. The heavy use of potatoes, cabbage, sour cream, and fatty
            meats makes for a perfect relaxing evening at home. My filter may
            be malfunctioning slightly, so there is a chance a couple Polish
            dishes and even a German one may slip in here.</p>

                <dd>Golutzby is a traditional dish which is essentially beef,
                rice seasonings and onions wrapped in cabbage leaves and
                cooked in a tomato sauce. It doesn't get much more
                delicious.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="stroganoff.html">Beef
                    Stroganoff</a></dt>
                <dd>This noodle dish is very hearty made with a thick cream of
                mushroom sauce and ground beef mixed with thick egg
                noodles.</dd>
                <dt><a class="recname" href="borscht.html">Borscht!!</a></dt>
                <dd>If you ask many people what Russian dish they can name,
                most people will say borscht. There are many ways to make it,
                but most commonly it is with a beef broth and beet base. It's
                almost like Russian style Gumbo</dd>
